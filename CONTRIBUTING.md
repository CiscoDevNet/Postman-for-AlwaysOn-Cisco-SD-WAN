# Contributing to DevNet SD-WAN API Postman Collection

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to DevNet SD-WAN API Postman Collection, which are hosted in the [Cisco DevNet](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/)on GitHub. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added/changed an API in the collection, please test this thoroughly.
3. Ensure you export a modified collection using Collection Format v2.1.
4. Ensure the exported collection/environment can be imported back into Postman.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed."
```


Thanks!
